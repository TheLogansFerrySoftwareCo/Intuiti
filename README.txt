INTUITI - A Software Intuition Engine

What is Intuiti?
-------------------------------
Intuiti is a framework for integrating the power of machine learning into .NET applications.  The framework is still in it's infancy, but as it matures, it will begin to provide developers with "Intuition Engines" with simplistic APIs for advanced machine-learning data analysis.


GOAL
----------
The goal of this project is to create a framework that enables .NET developers to easily integrate powerful machine learning algorithms into their everyday applications.
